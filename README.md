# YouTube Auto-Proceed to Video
[<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/chrome-gcs-uploader.appspot.com/image/WlD8wC6g8khYWPJUsQceQkhXSlv1/tbyBjqi7Zu733AAKA5n4.png">](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube-auto-proceed-to-v/lmjcoecpdenpmdoieiiendpoohgmabmd)

Are you tired of seeing this message on some YouTube videos?

<img src="https://github.com/ba32107/youtube-auto-proceed/blob/master/sample.png" width="450">

Then look no further. This extension can automatically proceed to the video - no more clicking necessary.

Note: it does not let you bypass the age verification check. It only works if you are already signed in, i.e. only for the message above.

The extension currently only works if YouTube's language is set to English.
