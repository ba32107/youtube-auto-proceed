# YouTube Auto-Proceed to Video

Are you tired of seeing this message on some YouTube videos?

Then look no further. This extension can automatically proceed to the video - no more clicking necessary.

Note: it does not let you bypass the age verification check. It only works if you are already signed in, i.e. only for the message above.

### Installation
The easiest way is to install directly from the Chrome Web Store (TODO: link).
 
Alternatively, you can install the extension manually from this repository:
 * Clone this repo or [download the code](https://github.com/ba32107/youtube-auto-proceed/archive/master.zip) and unzip it
 * Go to the Extensions page in Chrome (`chrome://extensions/`) and enable Developer mode in the upper right corner
 * Click `Load unpacked` and browse the `extension` directory from this repo
